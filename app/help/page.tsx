              The LLM reads recent market context over the configured lookback window, checks whether that context implies higher, lower, or stable volatility pressure, then returns its own recommended multiplier map beside the quant map. The UI shows both ladders side by side so the finance team can see exactly where the model agrees, tightens, or relaxes the deterministic trend-aware view.
